    <p><i>This document should be printed using your browser's native print function. Usually, this can be accessed using the key combination, CTRL+P.</i></p>
    <p>This document is a print-friendly report of the user's data stored on Eos. Mood data has been processed to generate clear graphs, whereas the rest of this data (such as comments) are direct input of the user.</p>
    <p><b>DATA CONTAINED WITHIN THIS DOCUMENT IS CONFIDENTIAL, AS EXPRESSED IN OUR <a href="legal.html">PRIVACY POLICY</a> (https://eos.dheaton.uk/legal.html).</b></p>
    <h2>For professionals</h2>
    <p>This document is intended to make doctor-patient communication easier, providing an initial breakdown of the user's past two weeks, their averages as Eos knows them, as well as any comments the user may have made regarding their thought processes and/or emotions associated with different states of mind.</p>
    <p>Professionals should acknowledge that all mood ratings are on a scale of -2 to 2. 'Positive' is defined as any mood rated greater than 0. 'Neutral' is defined as a mood rated 0. 'Negative' is defined as any mood rated less than 0.</p>
    <p>This document represents most, if not all, of the data that Eos has on this user (excluding chat data, which may be stored temporarily if a report was thrown during a chat conversation, but is <b>not</b> included here).</p>
