    <h1>Eos is unable to connect</h1>
    <p>Whoops, we can't connect to the server. ðŸ˜¥</p>
    <p>Steps to try:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure you're connected to a network with internet access;</li>
      <li>Check to see if your network is blocking Eos;</li>
      <li>See if other apps on your device are having network difficulties.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If none of the above work, the best we can suggest is simply <b>try again later.</b></p>
    <p>So sorry for the inconvenience, and make sure to look out for the native Eos app coming to an Android or Windows Phone device near you!</p>
