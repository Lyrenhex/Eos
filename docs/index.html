      <h1>Eos, the mental health app</h1>
      <p>Annually, we see a consistent trend: patients suffering from depression goes up and suicides rates increase but yet <b>discussion around mental health remains roughly unchanged</b>. Eos is a new kind of mental health app, which addresses to handle the problem.</p>
      <p>It's made <i>by mental health patients, for mental health patients</i>. We know what it's like, and that one of the key barriers to support is having to speak your thoughts aloud, or that people will recognise you, or...</p>
      <p>Eos supports your mental health professional to support you. Those thoughts? No need to say them aloud; log them with Eos, and when you're next due an appointment, just print off your personalised report and move on! That worry of recognition? Don't worry! Within Eos, everything is anonymous (and we don't do tracking, analytics, or anything like that), so you can feel as comfortable as possible. We don't pry.</p>

          <h2>Prepare for the inevitable</h2>
          <p>How often do you notice that you're elated one minute, but then feeling like your life's been pulled dragged along coals the next?</p>
          <p>We know what it's like, and one of the number one recommended steps by professional psychiatrists is to prepare for when you'll feel low.</p>
          <p>That's easier when you know <i>when</i> you'll feel low, so Eos uses your data over time to generate graphs, giving you an indication of what days and months you need to particularly look out for.</p>

            <h2>Help when you need it</h2>
            <p>Unlike your psychiatrist, Eos is always available*, and leads a community of like-minded individuals who are happy to listen and speak, to help you get through your struggles when you need the help most.</p>
            <p>They won't know who you are, what your life circumstances are; just that you use Eos, and are probably going through a lot at that moment! Eos cares, and the more people who use it, the better it becomes. So, why not try it for a spin? It will <b>always be free!</b></p>
            <p><small>(* Eos will be offline during routine maintenance and updates, but this will be kept to a minimum. Internet connectivity is required to use the app. Data center issues may disrupt the service, but are beyond our control.)</small></p>
