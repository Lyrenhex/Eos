      <h1>Support at your fingertips</h1>
      <p>Mental health services are declining, with budget cuts to national healthcare schemes; nonexistant mental health schemes; and a lack of understanding or education on the topic of mental health. Nowadays, it's frequent for people to simply tell you to "ring a hotline", and think their job is done... But what about those who <b>can't</b> ring a hotline? For fear of identification, of being seen as weak, or another multitude of reasons?</p>
      <p>It is for this reason that Eos was created: a modern, innovative solution to a rising crisis. The Eos app offers: mood tracking, to help identify trends and patterns (such as those prevalent within seasonally-affective disorders (SADs)); carefully considered, dynamic responses based on reported moods to provide resources when in low mood states; and one-on-one anonymous chats with another app user, allowing you to help them, to help yourself (and vice versa).</p>
      <p>For peace of mind, Eos is completely open-source, free software. We operate under a strict confidentiality agreement. <b>Why not take Eos for a spin, see how it works?</b></p>
