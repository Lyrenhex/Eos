        <h1>About the project</h1>
        <h2>What is Eos?</h2>
        <p>"Eos" is the Greek word, and goddess, for the dawn. It is from this that Eos, as an app, derives its name, for it is frequently said that it's "darkest just before the dawn"; a dawn that we hope to provide, to brighten the lives of countless people suffering from mental health conditions such as depression. Thus, Eos is a project for mental health support, aiming not so much to spread awareness for mental health (for there are many such projects already), but rather to complement clinical channels for handling mental health conditions (no app can ever replace a professional).</p>
        <p>Eos aims to complement such support by focusing on two primary goals:
            <ol>
                <li>Track the user's mood over time, to identify patterns and trends which might not be directly obvious; and</li>
                <li>Provide a platform for users to speak to each other and assist each other, supporting one another, with as little service interruption as possible.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h2>By whom?</h2>
        <p>Eos is developed with love, care, and devotion by <a href="https://dheaton.uk">Damian Heaton</a>, a student software engineer. In case you wondered, he's autistic, with a diagnosis of depression. Eos was built out of necessity, and is hoped to help many others during its time.</p>
        <p>A paper is being written to describe motivations, statistical analyses, the development of Eos, and any future considerations in greater detail. This will be published soon, and will be available for free online.</p>
        <h2>Social media</h2>
        <p>Interested in our social media? Sweet! We have a <a href="https://eoschat.tumblr.com">Tumblr blog</a> and a <a href="https://twitter.com/eoschat">Twitter</a>, where we post updates, changes, news, and general maintenance notices. It's a good idea to follow them!</p>
        <h2>Some people abuse anonymity.</h2>
        <p>We know all too well the dangers that arise from anonymity on the internet, and the things that some people can, despicably, say. However, the fact is that Eos would not be conducive for healthy, honest discussion of one's feelings if there was a third-party overseeing each and every conversation - not to mention the infeasibility of such a moderation approach.</p>
        <p>However, we do try to avoid toxic behaviour within the chat system as much as possible, acknowledging that people with mental health conditions are often much more vulnerable than neurotypically healthy individuals. Our approach to this is built around our confidentiality policy, passing all messages sent through <a href="https://perspectiveapi.com">Google's Perspective API</a>, to identify potentially hurtful things and check with the sender that the message is safe to be sent, and they understand the consequences.</p>
        <p>Of course, people can be toxic and ignore such warnings, even if it could lead to catastrophic consequences. Thus, we also allow for reporting of conversations through the use of the "I'm uncomfortable" button available from any chat. Use of this button will terminate the chat session, and, with the user's permission, send us a log of that chat for further investigation and handling of the offending account (our confidentiality agreement expressly states that conversation confidentiality is only maintained until a time that a user triggers a report).</p>
