        <title>Eos: No connection</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Oh, snap.</h1>
        <h2>It appears you don't have a connection.</h2>
        <p>Please check your internet connection and try again. Unfortunately, Eos will not operate without a sufficient internet connection. Try connecting to an available WiFi network or using mobile data.</p>
        <p>If you cannot access the internet right now, perhaps consider making note of how you're feeling right now, and inputting this data later on today when you can. This will still help us identify trends, and works around this limitation of the system.</p>
        <p>Many apologies for the inconvenience, and thank you for using Eos,</p>
        <p>The Eos development team.</p>
