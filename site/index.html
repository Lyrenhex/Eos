      <h2>Now in Public Beta</h2>
      <p>After 2 years of work, Eos is in good shape: core functionality is implemented solidly (in other words, we're <i>feature complete</i>), and after rigorous internal testing and a month-long sprint of closed alpha testing, we believe the system to be solid and robust.</p>
      <p>Before we hit play, however, and treat Eos as 'safe', we're running it at the moment in Public Beta.</p>
      <p>This means you can use Eos and its features as if it was live, and security follows the same standards as if we were stable -- we just can't give any <i>guarantees</i> that there won't be any bugs (including potentially catastrophic, loss-of-data kind of bugs) -- we're reasonably sure there's nothing that nasty though!</p>
      <p>Take Eos for a spin early, if you like, and shoot us some feedback on the Discord. Or wait until its <b>official launch on 1st January 2019</b>, if you'd rather be sure!</p>

      <h2>Support: always there</h2>
      <p>Whether it's just a bit of guidance on how to cope with what you're going through, or you need real, human interaction, Eos is there for you practically all the time.</p>
      <p>If your mood is low, we maintain a carefully curated list of suggestions for activities to do, which we'll present as appropriate, and we keep links with other helpful websites which we might recommend at times to help you get on the right track.</p>
      <p>If you need a human voice on the matter though, we're here for you too! Offering one-on-one, completely anonymous chats with another user of the service, we're certain you'll be able to find the help you need here.</p>
      <p>We're with you every step of the way to good mental health.</p>

      <h2>Tracking: data, for better care</h2>
      <p>Whenever you use Eos by recording your mood (or, as we call it, 'logging your mood'), we store that data in your personal profile. We never share this data, or sell it for profit -- it's for you only (and whoever you share it with, of course!)</p>
      <p>Displayed in an easy-to-understand graphical format, we take notice of the times that you've felt good or bad, and average this data out to get an idea of your mood over time. With this, you can use it to identify patterns in your mood; maybe you're always feeling down particularly on a Tuesday, so it's worth looking into what you do on Tuesday that's got you down? Or perhaps you suffer from a Seasonally Affective Disorder, and you're always low in November / December?</p>
      <p>Eos mood tracking is here to lift the burden of cataloging when you're low, so you can focus on what matters: using your coping strategies as soon as possible!</p>
